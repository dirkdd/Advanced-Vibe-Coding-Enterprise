# Token Optimization Rules

Description: Guidelines for efficient token usage
Globs: /**/*

Body:
  # Context management
  - Break long prompts into focused, task-specific requests
  - Prioritize relevant files in context (@file) references
  - Use @folders instead of individual @file references when appropriate
  - Clear conversation context when switching major tasks
  
  # Model selection
  - Use cursor-small model for simple refactoring tasks
  - Use GPT-4o for complex architectural decisions and cross-file implementations
  - Use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for documentation generation and context-heavy reasoning
  
  # File prioritization
  - Prioritize these files for context preservation:
    - Core configuration files (e.g., package.json, tsconfig.json)
    - Main architecture components
    - Currently active feature files
  - Exclude these from context unless specifically needed:
    - Test fixtures
    - Generated files
    - Third-party dependencies
    - Large data files
  
  # Token monitoring
  - Monitor context token usage and clear when approaching 80% of limit
  - Periodically restart sessions for complex, long-running projects
