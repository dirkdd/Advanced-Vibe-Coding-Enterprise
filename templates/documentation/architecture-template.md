# Architecture Document: [System/Component Name]

## How to Use This Template
1. Replace `[System/Component Name]` with your actual system or component name
2. Fill in all sections marked with square brackets
3. Update the UML diagrams to reflect your actual system architecture
4. Add or remove sections based on your system's specific requirements
5. Link to relevant implementation guides for each component

## Overview
[High-level description of the system or component and its purpose]

## Implementation References
For detailed implementation guidance on specific components, refer to the corresponding implementation guides created using the `templates/documentation/implementation-guide-template.md` template.

## System Context
[Description of how this system fits into the larger ecosystem]

@startuml
actor "User" as user
rectangle "System" {
[Component A]
[Component B]
[Component C]
}
database "Database" as db
user --> [Component A]
[Component A] --> [Component B]
[Component B] --> [Component C]
[Component C] --> db

## Components
### [Component A]
- **Purpose**: [Description of the component's responsibility]
- **Technology**: [Technologies used]
- **Interfaces**: [APIs or interfaces provided]
- **Dependencies**: [External dependencies]
- **Implementation Guide**: [Link to component-specific implementation guide]

### [Component B]
- **Purpose**: [Description of the component's responsibility]
- **Technology**: [Technologies used]
- **Interfaces**: [APIs or interfaces provided]
- **Dependencies**: [External dependencies]
- **Implementation Guide**: [Link to component-specific implementation guide]

## Data Flow
[Description of how data flows through the system]

@startuml
participant "Client" as client
participant "API Gateway" as gateway
participant "Service A" as serviceA
participant "Service B" as serviceB
database "Database" as db

client -> gateway: Request data
gateway -> serviceA: Forward request
serviceA -> db: Query data
db --> serviceA: Return data
serviceA -> serviceB: Process data
serviceB --> serviceA: Return processed data
serviceA --> gateway: Return result
gateway --> client: Return response
