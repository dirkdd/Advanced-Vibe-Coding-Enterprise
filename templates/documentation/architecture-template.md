# Architecture Document: [System/Component Name]

## Overview
[High-level description of the system or component and its purpose]

## Implementation References
For detailed implementation guidance on specific components, refer to the corresponding implementation guides created using the [Implementation Guide Template](/templates/documentation/implementation-guide-template.md).

## System Context
[Description of how this system fits into the larger ecosystem]

@startuml
actor "User" as user
rectangle "System" {
[Component A]
[Component B]
[Component C]
}
database "Database" as db
user --> [Component A]
[Component A] --> [Component B]
[Component B] --> [Component C]
[Component C] --> db

## Components
### [Component A]
- **Purpose**: [Description of the component's responsibility]
- **Technology**: [Technologies used]
- **Interfaces**: [APIs or interfaces provided]
- **Dependencies**: [External dependencies]

### [Component B]
- **Purpose**: [Description of the component's responsibility]
- **Technology**: [Technologies used]
- **Interfaces**: [APIs or interfaces provided]
- **Dependencies**: [External dependencies]

## Data Flow
[Description of how data flows through the system]

@startuml
participant "Client" as client
participant "API Gateway" as gateway
participant "Service A" as serviceA
participant "Service B" as serviceB
database "Database" as db

client -> gateway: Request data
gateway -> serviceA: Forward request
serviceA -> db: Query data
db --> serviceA: Return data
serviceA -> serviceB: Process data
serviceB --> serviceA: Return processed data
serviceA --> gateway: Return result
gateway --> client: Return response
