# Project-Specific Rules: [Project Name]

Description: Specific rules for [frontend/backend/infrastructure] implementation
Globs: projects/[project-name]/**/*

Body:
  # How to use this template:
  # 1. Replace [Project Name] in the header with your actual project name
  # 2. Replace [frontend/backend/infrastructure] with your project type
  # 3. Update the Globs pattern to match your project's folder structure
  # 4. Replace all placeholder values in square brackets with your specific values
  # 5. Add or remove sections based on your project's specific needs
  
  # Framework-specific guidelines
  - Use [Framework] version [X.Y.Z] conventions and best practices
  - Implement [Design Pattern] for component organization
  - Follow the established folder structure for new features
  - Ensure consistent state management using [State Management Pattern]
  
  # Testing requirements
  - Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for business logic
  - Include both unit and integration tests for API endpoints
  - Mock external dependencies in tests
  
  # Error handling
  - Implement centralized error handling for [specific component]
  - Use custom error classes for domain-specific errors
  - Include appropriate user-facing error messages
  
  # Performance guidelines
  - Optimize resource-intensive operations
  - Follow lazy loading patterns for [specific components]
  - Implement caching for frequently accessed data

# Documentation requirements
  - Update implementation guides when modifying features
  - Document all public APIs using standard format
  - Keep architecture diagrams in sync with code changes
