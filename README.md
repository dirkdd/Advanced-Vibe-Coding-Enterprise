### Directory Descriptions

- **documentation/**: Contains core methodology documents and implementation guides
- **examples/**: Real-world implementations demonstrating the methodology in practice
- **templates/**: Ready-to-use templates for cursor rules and project documentation
- **.cursor/**: Actual cursor rules that can be used by the repository itself


## Naming Conventions

This repository follows consistent naming conventions as outlined in the methodology:

- **Files and Folders**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `global-rules.mdc`, `token-optimization.mdc`)
- **Classes and Components**: Use PascalCase in code examples (e.g., `UserAuthentication`)
- **Functions and Variables**: Use camelCase in code examples (e.g., `validateUserInput`)
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE in code examples (e.g., `API_ENDPOINT`)


## Getting Started

For a quick start guide with a visual walkthrough, see [documentation/getting-started.md](documentation/getting-started.md).

### Prerequisites

- [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) installed on your development machine
- Git and GitHub account
- Basic understanding of AI-assisted development

### Using the Templates

This repository provides ready-to-use templates to accelerate your development process:

1. **Cursor Rules Templates**:
   - Copy `templates/cursor-rules/global-rules.mdc` to your project's `.cursor/rules.mdc` file
   - Adapt `templates/cursor-rules/project-specific-rules.mdc` for specific project components
   - Implement environment-specific configurations using `.cursor/rules/environment.mdc`

2. **Documentation Templates**:
   - Use `templates/documentation/implementation-guide-template.md` when implementing new features
   - Create architecture documentation with `templates/documentation/architecture-template.md`

3. **Error Prevention**:
   - Implement token optimization strategies from `.cursor/rules/token-optimization.mdc`
   - Use the error handling guidelines in `.cursor/rules/error-handling.mdc` to minimize environment-related issues


### Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/dirkdd/advanced-vibe-coding-enterprise.git
```

2. Familiarize yourself with the `documentation/methodology.md` document to understand the core principles.
3. When starting a new project, follow the `documentation/prompt-chain-implementation.md` document, beginning with the Baseline Configuration prompts.
4. Refer to the example implementations in `examples/` for practical demonstrations.

## How to Use with Cursor

To effectively use this repository with Cursor AI:

1. Open your project in Cursor.
2. Add this repository as context by referencing it in your prompt:

```
@filepath/to/advanced-vibe-coding-enterprise/documentation/methodology.md
@filepath/to/advanced-vibe-coding-enterprise/documentation/prompt-chain-implementation.md
@filepath/to/advanced-vibe-coding-enterprise/templates/cursor-rules/global-rules.mdc
```

3. Follow the prompt chain to guide Cursor through your development process:

```
Based on the Advanced Vibe Coding methodology I've attached as context, help me set up an initial minimal environment for my new [type of project] project...
```

4. As you progress through different phases of development, reference specific sections of the methodology to maintain context.

## Template Customization Guidelines

To adapt the templates for your specific project needs:

1. **Environment-Specific Rules**:
   - Edit `.cursor/rules/environment.mdc` to specify your actual OS, shell, and language versions
   - Update platform-specific commands in error handling rules

2. **Project-Specific Rules**:
   - Replace placeholder values in `templates/cursor-rules/project-specific-rules.mdc`
   - Add technology-specific guidelines (React, Node.js, Terraform, etc.)
   - Set appropriate glob patterns to target relevant files

3. **Documentation Templates**:
   - Add project-specific sections to implementation guides
   - Customize architecture diagrams with your actual system components
   - Extend templates with domain-specific requirements

4. **Rules Evolution**:
   - As your project grows, evolve your cursor rules following the guidance in `documentation/cursor-rules-evolution.md`
   - Implement regular reviews and versioning of your rules
   - Split rules into domain-specific files for larger projects

Refer to the `examples/web-application-example/` directory for specific customization examples.
