# Cursor Rules Evolution and Maintenance Guide

This document outlines strategies for evolving and maintaining Cursor Rules as your project grows and requirements change.

## Lifecycle of Cursor Rules

### Initial Setup Phase
- Start with minimal, essential rules that establish coding standards and documentation requirements
- Focus on universal patterns applicable to most parts of the codebase
- Keep rules general enough to avoid frequent changes

### Growth Phase
- Add domain-specific rules as patterns emerge in different parts of the application
- Create specialized rules for different technologies used in the project
- Implement team feedback loops to identify areas where AI assistance needs improvement

### Maturity Phase
- Refine rules based on accumulated project knowledge
- Periodically audit rules for relevance and effectiveness
- Document common exceptions and edge cases

## Maintaining Rules Across Project Evolution

### Regular Review Process
- Schedule monthly reviews of global Cursor rules
- After major milestones, evaluate if rules need updates to reflect new patterns
- Assign "rule stewards" responsible for maintaining different aspects of the rules

### Versioning Strategy
- Keep a changelog of significant rule changes
- Version your rules files to track evolution over time
- When making major changes, communicate updates to the team

### Modularity Approach
- Split rules into domain-specific files as the project grows
- Use inheritance patterns with base rules and specialized extensions
- Implement conditional rules that activate in specific contexts

## Rules Adaptation for Different Project Phases

### When to Update Rules
- When starting a new major feature or module
- After discovering recurring issues in AI-generated code
- When onboarding new team members with different preferences
- After adopting new frameworks or libraries
- When performance patterns need to be emphasized

### Practical Example of Rules Evolution

**Initial Rule:**
Description: Basic coding standards
Globs: /**/*.js
Body:

Use ES6 features when possible

Include JSDoc comments for functions

Follow camelCase naming convention

**Evolved Rule (3 months later):**
Description: Enhanced JavaScript standards
Globs: /**/*.js
Body:

Use ES6+ features with TypeScript type annotations

All public functions must have JSDoc with @param and @returns

Follow camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes

Implement error handling with custom error classes

Use async/await instead of promises where possible

Extract complex logic into testable pure functions

**Specialized Module Rule (6 months later):**
Description: API service layer standards
Globs: /src/services/**/*.js
Body:

Extends from base JavaScript standards

All service methods must implement retry logic

Use dependency injection pattern for external services

Include performance monitoring decorators

Cache expensive operations with configurable TTL

Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies


## Team Collaboration on Rules

- Use pull requests for rule changes to allow team discussion
- Document the reasoning behind rule changes
- Create a rules testing process to verify effectiveness
- Gather feedback from team members about AI behavior

By treating Cursor Rules as a living document that evolves with your project, you'll maximize the effectiveness of AI assistance throughout the development lifecycle.
