# Advanced-Vibe-Coding-Enterprise

#Starting prompt for use with Perplexity

I'm developing a comprehensive methodology called "Advanced Vibe Coding for Enterprise" for setting up and managing projects using Cursor AI paired with GitHub. I need you to research and synthesize a structured approach covering the entire development lifecycle. Please provide detailed insights on:

1. Workspace and Project Initialization and Structure
Research the optimal setup for:
Establishing a new AI-enhanced workspace in Cursor
Creating logical folder hierarchies for multi-project workspaces
Setting up GitHub repositories with appropriate branching strategies
Implementing standardized file/folder naming conventions
Configuring .gitignore files appropriate for various project types (especially infrastructure-as-code)

2. Cursor-Specific Rules and AI Enhancement
Detail best practices for:
Creating global Cursor rules (.mdc files) that apply workspace-wide
Developing project-specific rules with appropriate glob patterns
Implementing documentation-code consistency rules
Setting up context integration rules that automatically include relevant documentation
Designing phase-specific implementation rules for incremental development
Using rules to maintain documentation-code synchronization

3. Documentation Hierarchy and Management
Outline a comprehensive documentation structure covering:
Root-level workspace documentation (README.md)
Project-level technical documentation and roadmaps
Implementation guides with standardized templates
Architecture documentation (system diagrams, component relationships)
Runbooks and operational documentation
Maintenance checklists and workflows
Status tracking systems with standardized indicators (✅, ⏳, ❌)

4. AI-Assisted Development Workflow
Describe effective methodologies for:
Crafting initial discovery prompts to generate project specifications
Creating structured prompts for architecture design
Using AI to generate implementation guides from specifications
Maintaining documentation context during implementation
Developing phase-by-phase with appropriate AI context

5. Infrastructure-as-Code Best Practices
Detail approaches for:
Setting up Terraform-based projects within the larger workspace
Maintaining infrastructure documentation alongside code
Implementing state management and secure practices
Documenting deployment procedures and environment differences
Creating CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions

6. Automated Documentation Maintenance
Research systems for:
Automatically updating documentation when code changes
Using commit hooks to enforce documentation updates
Implementing "documentation as code" principles
Creating documentation validation workflows
Maintaining "Last Updated" timestamps and changelog procedures

7. Real-World Examples and Templates
Please provide:
Example Cursor rule files for documentation consistency
Templates for various documentation types (READMEs, implementation guides, etc.)
Sample folder structures for different project types
Example prompts for generating different documentation components
GitHub Actions workflow examples for documentation maintenance
The goal is to create a methodology that ensures consistent, high-quality documentation throughout the development lifecycle, with a clear hierarchical structure that guides developers from initial concept through to production deployment. The approach should leverage Cursor's AI capabilities while maintaining rigorous documentation standards.

The overall goal is to create a step by step guide that walks you through starting from any starting concept and working through prompting templates and informing the templates along the way to have the best chance of a successful pathway from concept to a production development launched. Be mindfull and analyze for any gaps in the current outline of the methodology.
